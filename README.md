# Local Galactic Structures

Scientifically grounded 3D model and data pipeline for the Solar neighborhood
(Gould Belt, Radcliffe Wave, Local Bubble, and nearby stellar/interstellar
structures). Full project spec: [`spec/Idea.md`](spec/Idea.md).

## Status

Scientific pipeline (Phases 1-2, spec §48): object schema, catalog storage,
RA/Dec/distance -> Galactic XYZ coordinate transforms, a live SIMBAD/Gaia/
VizieR + literature data-acquisition layer, and the initial >=20-object
catalog (spec §9) are built. The three scientific model layers - Gould Belt,
Radcliffe Wave, Local Bubble (spec §16-18) - are built as well. Scene export
and the Three.js web visualizer are separate, not-yet-implemented Stories —
see the `local-galactic-structures` GitHub Project board.

## Setup

```bash
cd local-galactic-structures
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Rebuild the initial catalog

```bash
python scripts/build_initial_catalog.py
```

Writes `data/normalized/catalog.parquet` and `data/normalized/catalog.csv`
from the checked-in, sourced records in
`data/normalized/initial_catalog_records.json` (spec §9's >=20-object seed
list - molecular clouds, star clusters, OB associations, the Vela SNR, and
the Local Bubble - each resolved live via SIMBAD/Gaia/VizieR where possible,
or from a cited literature distance otherwise; see each record's
`source.reference`). No live network access is required to rebuild from this
checked-in file (spec §14); re-resolving from scratch is a separate concern
handled by `src/local_galactic_structures/data_sources/`.

## Rebuild the scientific model layers

`models/gould_belt.yaml`, `models/radcliffe_wave.csv`, and
`models/local_bubble.yaml` are checked-in, literature-sourced configs loaded
by `gould_belt.py`/`radcliffe_wave.py`/`local_bubble.py` respectively -
nothing to rebuild; see each module's docstring for its source.

## Tests

```bash
pytest
```

A handful of data-acquisition tests are gated behind live network access to
SIMBAD/Gaia/VizieR and skipped by default; run
`LGS_RUN_NETWORK_TESTS=1 pytest` to include them.

## Notebook

```bash
pip install -e ".[notebook]"
jupyter lab notebooks/local_neighborhood.ipynb
```

`notebooks/local_neighborhood.ipynb` (spec §33) inspects the catalog, verifies
the coordinate transform, and plots the initial object set in 3D against the
Gould Belt / Radcliffe Wave / Local Bubble model layers using Plotly. It's a
validation/research tool, not the primary deliverable.

## Layout

- `src/local_galactic_structures/schema.py` — normalized `AstronomicalObject`
  Pydantic schema (spec §7).
- `src/local_galactic_structures/coordinates.py` — RA/Dec/distance -> Galactic
  l/b and heliocentric Galactic Cartesian XYZ, via `astropy.coordinates` only
  (spec §6).
- `src/local_galactic_structures/catalog.py` — flatten/unflatten
  `AstronomicalObject` records to/from `data/normalized/catalog.parquet`
  (+ CSV for inspection).
- `src/local_galactic_structures/data_sources/` — the `ObjectResolver`
  interface plus SIMBAD/Gaia/VizieR/literature adapters, with local caching
  and provenance tracking (spec §11-12, §14).
- `src/local_galactic_structures/{gould_belt,radcliffe_wave,local_bubble}.py`
  — the three scientific model layers (spec §16-18), each config-driven from
  a file under `models/`.
- `data/{raw,normalized,derived}/` — strict raw -> normalized -> derived data
  separation (spec §13). `raw/` is never modified in place.
- `notebooks/local_neighborhood.ipynb` — scientific validation notebook
  (spec §33).
